Project Title: Predicting Automobile Car Prices

Data Source: Kaggle - Automobile Dataset

Programming Language: Python 3.11

Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Streamlit

Introduction:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of automobile cars based on various features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and is titled "Automobile". Python version 3.11 is utilized for the development, and several libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost are employed for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

Data Preprocessing:
1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the Python environment using Pandas.
2. Column Renaming: Columns with abbreviated names are renamed to their full names for better understanding and clarity.
3. Missing Values Handling: Null values are checked in the dataset, and missing values are filled with the mode for categorical data and the mean for numerical data to ensure completeness.
4. Categorical Data Encoding: Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoder to convert them into numerical format, which is required for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering:
Feature importance is determined using XGBoost Regressor, which helps identify the most influential features for predicting car prices. This step aids in selecting the most relevant features for modeling, thereby improving the model's predictive performance.

Modeling:
XGBoost Regressor is chosen as the predictive modeling algorithm due to its robustness and efficiency in handling both numerical and categorical features. Regression is chosen over classification since the target variable (car prices) is continuous and requires a regression approach for prediction.

Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2) score to assess the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the model.

Deployment:
Streamlit is utilized for sharing the machine learning project, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input car features and obtain predicted prices instantaneously.

Conclusion:
Through this machine learning project, we have developed a predictive model capable of accurately estimating automobile car prices based on various features. By employing data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and XGBoost regression modeling, we have created a robust and efficient solution for predicting car prices, which can be accessed and utilized through the Streamlit interface.
